### Project Description
DejaView is a humorous web app that "scans" your uploaded photo and reveals a completely ridiculous past life story.  
From being a medieval potato farmer to a moon cheese inspector, your past self is about to be exposedâ€¦ with style.  

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People everywhere are suffering from *not knowing* they were once royal sock designers or pirateâ€™s pet parrots.  
This lack of useless historical self-awareness is a tragedy that simply cannot continue.  

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a highly advanced fake AI scanning system that analyses your aura, karmic wrinkles, and facial potato-to-spoon ratio to determine your past life in seconds.  
And yesâ€¦ itâ€™s 100% scientifically inaccurate, but 200% fun.
